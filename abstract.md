###Peer to peer file sharing via mobile phones

##Abstract

In late 1990’s and early in last decade (2000-2010) mobile phones were used for voice communications. For past 10 years, mobile device becomes more powerful to handle multimedia documents, personal productivity applications and all sort of internet connections. Nowadays mobile devices play major role in day to day life and with internet connection available anywhere with mobile devices, users can communicate with files like documents, images, etc., other than voice communication. Mobile users can transfer files with the technologies like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi etc. This paper also proposes a method called StegTorrent, which is a new network steganographic method for the popular P2P file transfer service, BitTorrent. It is based on modifying the order of data packets in the peer-peer data exchange protocol. It does not require any synchronization unlike other existing steganographic methods that modify the packet’s order.
